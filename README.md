# LearnVueJs
This is the repo to learn vuejs from basic.
From the vue 3.4.9. there have important changed script import from:
https://unpkg.com/vue@next to https://unpkg.com/vue@3.4.9/dist/vue.global.js

# chapterOne
Adding styles.css, index.html and app.js to create the first application.
In this chapter, we will learn about create and connect Vue App instances, interpolation and data binding,
binding attributes with the v-bind directive, methods, working with data inside (using $this) and usage of v-html for outputting rawHtml content.


# chapterTwo
Update styles.css, index.html and app.js from the chapterOne. 
In this chapter, we will learn about strong of JS, namely events. We will learn also about methods, working with arguments,
using the native object, explore more event modifiers, and locking content with v-once. We also learn about two-way binding using v-model to replace
v-bind:value and v-on:input together, and how to work, introducing computed properties, working with watchers, differentials usage of methods vs computed
proeprties vs watchers. In this chapter, we also learn about performances of vueJs, and we try to display in console log also. Hopefully we can know about
usage of methods and computed properties, when we use methods & computed, because that is impacted to performance of vueJs.
